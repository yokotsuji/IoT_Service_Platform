# IoT_Service_Platform


This repository provides an implementation of an **IoT service platform** and an **LLM-based agent** for evaluating and supporting intelligent IoT service selection.  
The project focuses on enabling interoperability between heterogeneous IoT devices and providing standardized interfaces for both atomic and complex IoT services.  
By combining these services with Large Language Models (LLMs), the platform allows agents to interpret natural language queries and select appropriate IoT services effectively.
